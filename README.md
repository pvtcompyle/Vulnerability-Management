# Vulnerability-Management
Nessus scan report consolidator and parser

Background:
As a part of on going development of a Vulnerability Management Program, I found a need for better prioritization of systems needing
remediation. Since I only have Nessus pro available, I have limited functionality available beyond running the scans. With average
total network detections consistently over 20,000, I lacked available time to effectively prioritize the scans beyond the most critical 
systems (ie, servers). I decided to undertake a project to develop a python script to assiste with this. 

This script, when executed, will list all of the csv files located in the working directory. On those files it will:
    1. Copies the files to a different directory and changes the current working directory to that path.
    2. Renames the files using the scandate as a datestamp (ex. 201910 for October 2019).
    3. Prune all low and informational detections from the files
    4. Create a summary showing how many critical, high, and medium vulnerabilites each host has.
    5. Assigns a risk score to each host in the summary files.
    6. Separates each hosts vulnerabilities into their own csv file.
