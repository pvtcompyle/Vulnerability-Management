# Vulnerability-Management
Nessus scan report consolidator and parser

Background:
As a part of on going development of a Vulnerability Management Program, I found a need for better prioritization of systems needing
remediation. Since I only have Nessus pro available, I have limited functionality available beyond running the scans. With average
total network detections consistently over 20,000, I lacked available time to effectively prioritize the scans beyond the most critical 
systems (ie, servers). To aid with this, I decided to undertake a project to develop a python script to assiste with this. 

This script, when executed, will list all of the csv files located in the working directory. On those files it will:
    1. Consolidate the files into a single file
    2. Prune all low and informational detections from the consolidated file
    3. Add fields indicating the scan month and type of scan each record came from
    4. Break each host into its own file
    5. Create a summary showing how many critical, high, and medium vulnerabilites each host has
    6. Assigns a risk score to each host to aid in prioritization
